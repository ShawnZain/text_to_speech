# TEXT TO SPEECH PROGRAM
This program reads a pdf file and converts it to an mp3 file.

## Step 1
- Set up your virtual environment. The best way I have found when using VS Code is this below **website**:

## Step 2
- After activating the virtual environment, we can instal the necessary packages:
  1. pyttsx3: `pip3 install pyttsx3`
  1. PyPDF2: `pip3 install PyPDF2`
- The `pyttsx3` package is what will be used to convert the pdf to mp3
- The `PyPDF2` package is used to handle pdf files

> HAPPY CODING!!!
